# photo-clouds

A Python codebase that inputs a planetary wind speed profile and optionally a time and flux light curve array and outputs a lightcurve of the base frequencies and a simulated light curve from a basic model of clouds passing over the albedo. 

Time and flux arrays may be input as a .txt file with np.loadtxt(file_name, comments="#", delimiter=" ", unpack=False).
